I"ó<p>When I went to Art College, it became clear on day one that you just did not paint pretty pictures. Everything had to be exploratory, and the more abstract in deed and thought, then the better chance you had of good grades. It did not seem to occur to the lecturers, that most of us hadnâ€™t a clue about life, let alone express it in relevant abstract forms. None the less I had three years enjoying myself painting 12 foot long weird things, and welding giant sculptures out of scrap iron.</p>
