I" <p>WHY The thing I hear all the time from people is,” It must be wonderful to have a talent, I can’t do anything” . That is so depressing to hear. Everyone can if they wish, find something that they have an aptitude for, or can practice at, to become good. The real stumbling block is that most get caught up in job’s,family or whatever, and never really try. My talent is limited, but I just want to do it. Looking at great artists makes me depressed, that I can’t achieve those hights, but it also makes me want to keep trying.</p>
