<p>1. Stop doing a diary about what you ate, or watched on television.</p>

<p>2. Grab a pen and fresh notebook, or practice your one fingered typing skills, put down everything that could eventually be expanded into an incident. It does not matter if the original event was not that amusing or interesting, artistic license will allow you to improvise, after all it is fiction.</p>

<p>3. Put down any and everything that comes into your head, don’t worry about how bad an idea it is, or your spelling, just go with the flow and brainstorm. Someone recently said, “Write like a maniac” and that is exactly how you should approach it. Don’t let negative thoughts get in the way.Use short bursts of writing (15 minutes a time) and put down anything that comes from your musings. Don’t worry about how it sounds when you read it back, just go with the flow.Remember, first the ideas, pruning and construction can come later. Write every day, make it a habit, you can set aside time, but if something prevents you then you have lost valuable writing time. I have a pad and pen in my back pocket, I will write whilst the kettle is boiling, or even sitting on the loo (sorry about the imagery) but there are plenty of five minute moments, when you could easily add a short paragraph or two. Little and often can work better than long stretches at the keyboard. If you see a pattern emerging in your writing, then maybe that is the direction your first book should go in. However, it does not matter if you end up with pages of non-linkable ideas, they are all potential starting points. Ask yourself questions, and then answer the question.</p>

<p>4. Finally (It does not matter how long this takes, never feel guilty or under pressure) When you think you have the basic idea, try and see if you can find ways to split it into twelve sections. If it is a fiction story, have a beginning and an end that takes care of two. Now try to imagine a set of circumstances that can link the two together.</p>

<p>5. Once you have started, ideas will pop into your head at all the wrong moments, so have a pen and note pad handy, by your bed, in the car and a tiny one in your pocket. If you see an interesting article, or hear something on the radio, make a note of it.</p>

<p>6. Don’t get distracted, little and often is better than full steam ahead thaen stopping for ages. Initial enthusiasm will wane, so get into a habit, which keeps it all going.</p>

<p>7. ENJOY,! what is the point of doing something that is a grind.</p>

<p>I like amusing fiction stories, but if your thing is describing toy trains over the last thirty years, then just go for it. The only rule is rule number 7, if it is not fun, then don’t do it.</p>
