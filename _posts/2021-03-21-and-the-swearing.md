# &nbsp;WRITING A FICTION NOVEL

I was in your shoes until a year or so ago, every night I would write up my diary, which to be honest was all rather depressing, when I re-read it. You know the sort of thing, raining again, hard day at the office etc., as if anyone would want to read that. Then out of sheer boredom I started trying to be funny, and to my surprise I opened up a side of my character that was not actually just amusing to me, but to my friends when they read it. I was never any good at telling jokes, could never get the timing right, but with writing it seemed to go along easily, I was actually laughing my way to my first book without even knowing it. I often type whilst giggling to myself over what’s coming out on the paper.

The following paragraph that comes from my first book was written just as it came into my head at the time. Here the Art Teacher is trying to get out of a difficult situation, after he was heard swearing in class.

“And the swearing?” responded the Headmaster.

“Male menopause,” replied Brian.

“Good grief, what next, said Mr Redbone.

“It exists you know,” said Brian, warming to a possible escape route from his dilemma. “Recent studies have shown that men try to pass it off as just stress of overwork, or something. But it has all the same symptoms that affect women.

Fatigue, hot flushes, severe headaches, and you can add to that male aggression, and sexual dysfunction.”

The headmaster was by this time slumped in his chair thinking that this teacher had far too much creativity for his liking.

“Stop right there Mr Wilson. I hope you are not suggesting that you should be given some time off because of male menopause? Good grief\! we would have half the staff off complaining of severe mood swings. And the Department of Education would have to supply all its male teachers with free patches.”

“That’s very funny Sir.”

“Shut up,” said the Headmaster

I don’t claim to be a great writer and you don’t have to be to develop your ideas and get them down on paper. Not everyone will share your sense of humour, or like your serious writing, but many out there will empathize with your characters, what a great thing to share.
