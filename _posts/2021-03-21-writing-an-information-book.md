If the end result is to make an information book like this one, then you need to spend most of your time gathering information, and placing it in logical order. If you already have a passion for the subject then it is possible that you already know enough to fill twelve chapters. Let us suppose that you like Art. This in itself is a big subject, so you need to define exactly what area you are going to write about.

**For example:**&nbsp;&nbsp; History, oil painting, famous paintings, artists of the world, watercolour techniques, etc.

Having chosen the specific topic, get a small notebook. Use one page for each chapter, and write down twelve sub headings

**For instance:**

**Watercolour Techniques.**

1\. Equipment

2\. Setting up a space or studio

3\. Preparation

4\. Finding subject matter and recording

5\. Initial sketching, methods

6\. Wet in Wet

7\. Light and shade

8\. Texture

9\. Atmosphere

10\. Figures

11\. Variations

12\. Summeary

With each of these chapters choose three subheadings.

For instance:

5\. Initial sketching could be **Layout, what to put in or leave out, and proportion.**

9 Atmosphere could be **limiting colour, letting the paint run, or using salt etc.**

11\. Variations could be **Pen and wash, watercolour over acrylic base, or inks.**

&nbsp;

The average e-book does not have to be as long as a fiction story. If you write a paragraph on the main heading then one each for subsequent sub headings, you will have almost ten thousand words, which for this type of book is more than enough.

**SO CHOOSE YOUR TOPIC, PICK YOUR CHAPTER HEADINGS AND THE THREE SUB HEADINGS PER CHAPTER. WRITE ONE PARAGRAPH EACH NIGHT.**
