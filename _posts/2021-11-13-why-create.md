WHY CREATE

Every single thing around us was designed, either by nature or the hand of man. The shape and composition is created to fulfil some purpose. Creativity is what has dragged us from the primordial slime, to a position where we are considering visiting other planets, or obliterating ourselves. Could you imagine a world devoid of design, well actually there would not be one.

We leave the movers and shakers, the real brains and those with overriding passions for change, to do their best. The rest of us have far less ambition and use our creativity for more modest ambitions. The world is full of Designers, Artists, Musicians, Poets, Writers, etc. The internet has provided a fertile base from which there has been an explosion. It provides not only a platform for people to show what they can do, but also a vast audience at the tap of a few keys.

Some will point to lower standards, in the past only a minority got to publish or have high profile exhibitions, those with exceptional talent, or the right contacts. But the upsurge can only be good for us as a whole. It brings forth new talent, ideas and schemes. It fosters the inner urge to create, even at basic level, and it puts people with similar interests in touch with each other.

My art and ideas may not be important beyond me, but if you are reading this then at least you now know what I do and think. Multiply this across millions of people expressing themselves online and the effect on developing new avenues of creativity is staggering to think about.

When I was a teacher, most of the creative subjects such as Art, music, drama, domestic science and others were considered of secondary importance to Maths, Science and English. I do not doubt the value of these three stalwarts, although I hardly use two of them on any regular basis. However it would be a very boring dull world without creative subjects, they make us who we are.
