          <h1>About John</h1>
          <p>I was born in Sheffield in 1948. My father was an architect, who helped design the Planitarium in London. During the war he drew portraits of his comrade's loved ones, in exchange for cigarettes or chocolate. My Grandmother was a potter and my Great, Great Grandfather designed the Reados in St Pauls Cathedral. The figures on Holburn viaduct were based on his wife.</p>
          <p>At school I was only any good at practical subjects, but still found myself going to college and getting a teaching certificate. Most of my adult life was spent between spells at various schools, and then leaving to try and make it as an artist. This repeated itself several times over the next thirty years. I have had numerous <a href="/exhibitions/">exhibitions</a> and sold regularly, details are included in my qualifications section. Somewhere along the path I also gained a B.A. Degree with Honours.</p>
          <p>In 2004 I decided that it was time for a change, so I packed my car and headed to a mountain village in Andalucia. The area was stunning but unfortunately the house was a bit of a disaster. I stuck it for three years, making friends, learning the culture and language of my new life.</p>
          <p>In 2007 I moved inland and puchased a large cave house, mostly in serious need of repair, but with loads of space and land to create my own vision. The plan still is to open part of it as a Gallery for anyone to come and wander around.</p>
          <p>Between painting I have managed to write eight books. Two of them are about my experiences in Spain. If you want to know more, please look at the <a href="/books-and-articles/">book section</a>.</p>
